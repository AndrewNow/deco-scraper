Known for its generous proportions and bold aesthetic, the Mole model (meaning \"soft\" in Portuguese) is a masterpiece of craftsmanship and comfort, designed to offer an unparalleled lounging experience.\n\nA Robust Wooden Frame with Leather Strap Weaving\nThe solid wooden frame is a defining characteristic of these armchairs, emphasizing the raw beauty of natural materials and the strength of Brazilian craftsmanship. The structure is composed of rich hardwood, carefully shaped and polished to highlight its natural grain and warmth. The distinctive sculptural quality of the frame gives these armchairs a commanding presence, making them a focal point in any living space. Supporting the large, oversized leather cushions is a unique interwoven leather strap system, an innovative feature that defines the Mole armchair's structure and comfort. This intricate weave of thick leather fibers ensures a firm yet flexible base, allowing the cushions to adapt naturally to the sitter's body. The seamless integration of wood and leather reflects Rodrigues' ability to blend traditional craftsmanship with modernist principles, creating a chair that is as visually striking as it is functional. With their bold proportions and inviting depth, these armchairs are perfectly suited for large living rooms with a mid-century aesthetic, where comfort and style go hand in hand. Their expansive and sculptural form makes them ideal for statement seating arrangements, whether in private residences, designer lofts, or high-end hospitality spaces.</span></div></div>",
