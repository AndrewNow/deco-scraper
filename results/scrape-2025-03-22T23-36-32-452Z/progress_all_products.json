The beautiful two-tone fabric upholstery emphasizes the sculptural quality of the monumental design. \nPlease note that this sofa is from a more recent production by One Collection in Denmark, now known as House of Finn Juhl. House of Finn Juhl is the licensed manufacturer of the designs of Finn Juhl.\nThe sofa was exhibited in a boardroom for 20 years but hardly used. It is in immaculate condition.\nMarked with a signature and the early round medaillon label as pictured.\n\nFinn Juhl (1912-1989) was a Danish furniture designer and architect, best known for his innovative and expressive furniture designs. He was a pioneer of the Danish Modern movement, which emphasized simplicity, functionality, and the use of natural materials. Juhl's work is characterized by its sculptural forms, organic shapes, and use of vibrant colors. His most famous pieces include the Chieftain Chair and the 45 Chair. Juhl's designs have influenced generations of designers and continue to be celebrated for their timeless elegance and innovative spirit."

Combining striking lightness with boldness, this armchair not only optimizes the furniture space but also infuses your space with a distinctive personality. A rare, unique piece, appealing to decorators and art enthusiasts in search of originality and exceptional pieces.\n\nThe seating, crafted in black TPU, revolutionizes the furniture sector with its innovative design and unique aesthetics. It distinguishes itself through its durability.\n\nOlivier Santini was born in 1966. He has been drawing since childhood, prioritizing ideas and originality. During his student years, he developed a deep interest in aesthetics, graphic contours, and the properties of materials, while enjoying opportunities to interact and exchange ideas with art artisans. At the age of 20, he founded a group of marketing and design agencies, putting his experience and creativity at the service of clients, achieving immediate success. While analyzing furniture designs, he noticed a lack of variety, color, and uniqueness, leading him to create his own furniture collection. His goal was to create different, fun, and vibrant furniture with optimistic and refreshing colors that bring light and joy to both indoor and outdoor spaces. \n\nMIAW 2022 Design Award Winner.</span></div></div>",
