Best known for his design of the Djinn line of furniture, Mourgue’s aesthetic is characterized by brightly colored jersey fabric stretched over structural steel frames that are filled with polyether foam, creating a unified, futuristic, alien-like modular form. Born in Paris, France in 1939, he began his career with an innovative design for a chaise lounge in 1964, after which he expanded his original furniture line to include loveseats, stools, and anthropomorphic chairs. Despite also producing paintings and drawings, his career was ultimately dedicated to industrial design, and provided a quintessential aesthetic of 1960s Modernist furniture. His influence is noted by his work’s inclusion in popular culture landmarks such as Stanley Kubrik’s 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey. \n\nShipping:\nThese armchairs will be packaged and shipped with the greatest care and attention to make sure you will receive the items in gallery condition.</span></div></div>",
