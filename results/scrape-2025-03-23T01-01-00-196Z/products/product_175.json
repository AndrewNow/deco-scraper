The furniture created in this style reflects this transitional period, with forms that stood as a bridge between the neoclassicism of the earlier Regency style and the more extravagant Victorian style that would follow.\n\nIt represents an evolution towards a more robust and decorative furniture, because, although it is inspired by the straight and sober lines of the neoclassical, it begins to integrate curved and more decorative details. There is a return to rococo influences, but adapted to achieve a more robust and durable appearance. In some cases, more striking decorative carvings appear, such as acanthus leaves, volutes and floral motifs, especially on chair backs and table stands. These decorations give a naturalistic and ornamental touch.\n\nInspired by ancient Greece and Rome, the designs were often more imposing than Regency furniture. They were characterized by straight lines and faint ornamentation, compared to those of the time of George IV. William IV had a laid-back air and was much more formal, while the ruler who preceded him was a much more extravagant king. Noble woods such as mahogany or palosanto were used, often in dark tones. The choice of these woods sought to create a solid and luxurious presence, with finishes that highlighted the natural vetting of the wood.\n\n\nStyle: William IV\nMaterial: Mahogany\nPeriod: 19th Century\nCountry of Origin: United Kingdom\nGood condition for its age and use\nOverall dimensions: 120 x 230 x 128 cm.</span></div></div>",

        "description": "Outstanding  “bed de repos”, a multifunctional piece of furniture that can be used as a bed, as well as for resting, reclining or simply sitting. Its structure, of imposing dimensions, is of wood, probably mahogany, widely used in that period. The set is completed with four large cushions, two for the back and two for the sides, in addition to the capitoné seat and a pair of rolls.\n\nWilliam IV of the United Kingdom (1765-1837) was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Hanover, from 26 June 1830 until his death in 1837. His reign was short, but it was a crucial time of change , in which parliamentary reform led to the current constitutional monarchy. The furniture created in this style reflects this transitional period, with forms that stood as a bridge between the neoclassicism of the earlier Regency style and the more extravagant Victorian style that would follow.\n\nIt represents an evolution towards a more robust and decorative furniture, because, although it is inspired by the straight and sober lines of the neoclassical, it begins to integrate curved and more decorative details. There is a return to rococo influences, but adapted to achieve a more robust and durable appearance. In some cases, more striking decorative carvings appear, such as acanthus leaves, volutes and floral motifs, especially on chair backs and table stands. These decorations give a naturalistic and ornamental touch.\n\nInspired by ancient Greece and Rome, the designs were often more imposing than Regency furniture. They were characterized by straight lines and faint ornamentation, compared to those of the time of George IV. William IV had a laid-back air and was much more formal, while the ruler who preceded him was a much more extravagant king. Noble woods such as mahogany or palosanto were used, often in dark tones. The choice of these woods sought to create a solid and luxurious presence, with finishes that highlighted the natural vetting of the wood.\n\n\nStyle: William IV\nMaterial: Mahogany\nPeriod: 19th Century\nCountry of Origin: United Kingdom\nGood condition for its age and use\nOverall dimensions: 120 x 230 x 128 cm.",
