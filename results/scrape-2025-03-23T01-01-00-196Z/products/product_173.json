This chair has an interesting, sculptural shape, the legs and armrests blend over into each other creating a gap between the seat and the armrest. The carved edges of the frame are delicate and make this chair a little more sophisticated than other designs by the duo. The back consists of spindles that hold the back cushion in a curved, comfortable position. The combination of the darkened oak and woolen fabric is timeless, warm and stylish.\n\nThe French designer duo Jacques Chambron (1914-2001) and Robert Guillerme (1913-1990) started their production postwar. Robert Guillerme studied design and architecture at the École Boule and graduated first in his class in 1934. Meanwhile, Jacques Chambron graduated from the School of Applied Arts in Reims. During the Second World War, the two met in a stalag, a Prussian prisoner camp, while being imprisoned by the Germans in East Prussia and started a great friendship based on their intense and deep passion for interior design. In 1948, Chambron resigned from his job as a painter and decorator on the Rue Nollet in Paris to move to Lille, in the North of France and join Guillerme. A year later, the two met cabinetmaker Émile Dariosecq, who was the owner of a workshop close by. It was during this meeting, that they decided to create their own company. They named it “Votre Maison”, meaning “Your Home”, which became the soul of the company. With this, they wanted to create pieces that focused on functionality combined with a beautiful design useful for daily life, by which they created a worldwide reputation. Most of the furniture designed by this duo shows a strong character and has a great expressive woodwork. The three of them divided their work equally. Overall, Guillerme worked as a designer, Chambron as a commercial, and Dariosecq’s workshop manufactured the pieces. Throughout their career, ‘Votre Maison’ produced over two thousand models, leaving a lasting mark in the world of design.</span></div></div>",
