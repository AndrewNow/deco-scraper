The design is inspired by the classic designs from the 1940s but with our own design variations and up-dated dimensions. The chairs are based on a hand-built frame built on the same craftsman traditions used back in the 1940s with a wooden frame and coil springs held in place by webbing. The chairs are padded with modern foam and padding materials as opposed to the straw and horsehair of yesterday. The chairs maintain a sculptural organic shape and harmonious proportions which combined with a relatively compact size make them very versatile and suitable for today's urban homes. Raised on stained beech legs and plywood frame. The chairs have been upholstered in a light amber colored curly shearling sheepskin skin (S519C) from Garrett Leather adding unparalleled luxury to any room. Excellent new condition. The chairs can be upholstered in a number of different variations of shearling and/or fabric.\nSingle chair as well as custom ottoman is also available.</span></div></div>",
