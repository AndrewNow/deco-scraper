Klein for Bramin Dining Side Chairs in Oak and Blush Pink Velvet, Denmark, 1960s\n\nAdd a touch of Scandinavian elegance to your dining space with this exquisite set of six side dining chairs, designed by H.W. Klein for Bramin Møbler in Denmark during the 1960s. A perfect embodiment of Danish Modern design, these chairs showcase Klein’s signature style—combining fluid, minimalist forms with exceptional craftsmanship. Crafted from solid oak, the frames feature a warm, rich grain that highlights the natural beauty of the wood, while the slender, angled legs create a light, airy silhouette.\n\nThe seats have been reupholstered in a luxurious blush pink velvet, adding a soft, contemporary contrast to the timeless oak frames. This delicate hue brings a modern flair to the classic mid-century design, making these chairs a versatile addition to both vintage and modern interiors. The chairs are in great vintage condition, showing signs of age and use through light scuffs and slight wear to the finish, which only enhance their character and authenticity.\n\nH.W. Klein, a Norwegian-born designer who trained under Finn Juhl, is renowned for his contributions to Danish Modern design, including the iconic Ønskestolen lounge chair. Bramin Møbler, a leading Danish manufacturer, collaborated with Klein to produce some of the most coveted furniture of the mid-20th century, known for their quality and simplicity. This set of chairs is a testament to their shared legacy, offering both style and functionality for the discerning collector.\n\nDesigner: H.W.
