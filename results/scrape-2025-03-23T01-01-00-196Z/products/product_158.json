        "description": "Ennio Chiggio “Environ” modular sofa for Nikol International, 1969\n\nThe Ennio Chiggio \"Environ\" sofa for Nikol International, designed in the 1960s, is a rare and exquisite piece of Italian design. This large modular sofa comprises five elements made from polyurethane foam, covered in a soft, patterned fabric. The sofa's generous, rounded lines and low backrest are upholstered in a distinctive fabric. The modular components can be easily reconfigured using its discrete straps, allowing for versatile seating arrangements.\nThe \"Eviron\" sofa features three curved seating modules and two backrest elements, creating a cohesive and comfortable seating experience. The smooth finish enhances its luxurious feel, making it a standout piece in any interior setting.\nIn the late 1960s, the historic-artistic group GRUPPO N from Padua collaborated with NIKO International, specializing in interior architecture. The full GRUPPO N comprises Alberto Biasi, Ennio Chiggio, Toni Costa, Edoardo Landi, and Manfredo Massironi. Carlo Scarpa, renowned for his meticulous attention to detail and use of materials, found the experimental and collective approach of GRUPPO N particularly intriguing. The group's emphasis on structural elements and visual perception likely aligned with Scarpa's work, known for blending traditional craftsmanship with modernist principles.\n\nWe accurately check the quality of each object. Our in-house atelier carefully reviews every item. We offer custom restoration and special reupholstering on request. Contact us for more information.\n\nMeasurements:\nLeft module:\nDepth: 66.92 in (170 cm)\nWidth: 66.92 in (170 cm)\nHeight: 23.62 in (60 cm)\n\nRight module:\nDepth: 51.19 in (130 cm)\nWidth: 110.23 in (280 cm)\nHeight: 23.62 in (60 cm)\n\nFront module:\nDepth: 51.19 in (130 cm)\nWidth: 94.49 in (240 cm)\nHeight: 12.99 in (33 cm)\n\nSeat depth: 13.78 in (35 cm)",
