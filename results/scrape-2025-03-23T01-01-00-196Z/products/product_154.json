This particular model, named Kurul, was produced by EG Kvalitetsmøbel in Denmark. The chair bears the manufacturer's label on the inside of the frame.\n\nCrafted from solid oak, the armchair blends the classic kurul design with soft, rounded contours. It features an upholstered seat and backrest, while the oak frame is intricately carved and sculpted—showcasing the craftsmanship of both designer and maker. The chair also functions beautifully as a stylish addition to a desk or office setting.\n\nThe piece is in very good condition, with the wood displaying a natural, even patina. The seat and backrest have been reconditioned and newly upholstered in a beautiful ivory Rubelli bouclé fabric.\n\nKjærnulf’s style—marked by organic modernism and occasional brutalist references—fits seamlessly within the Scandinavian modern tradition. His preference for raw, pure woods like oak, along with his distinctive carved details, aligns his work with international contemporaries such as Charlotte Perriand, Pierre Chapo, and Guillerme et Chambron, who were active during the same era.</span></div></div>",
