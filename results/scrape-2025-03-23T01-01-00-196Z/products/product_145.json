What makes them special is the apparent absence of supporting structure, the extreme naturalness of the shape, the synthesis of comfort, softness and elasticity that their appearance communicates with effective evidence.\n\nFor all the iconic furniture of Italian design follow our gallery SECONDA GIOVINEZZA, we offer restoration service and personalized search.",
