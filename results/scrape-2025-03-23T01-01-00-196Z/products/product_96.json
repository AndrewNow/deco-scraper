This fabric of uneven yarn that has an uneven knobby effect matches perfectly with the classic and iconic lines of this chair. Very comfortable seat. Professionally restored to showroom condition. Chairs have been taken apart re-glued and re-upholstered by our artisan.\n\nWe have not been able so far, to trace these chairs back to a Designer. It is clearly in the manner of Guillerme et Chambron and were bought in the region where their workshop was located. \n\nTry to find a second pair. If you want something rare and out of the ordinary  this should be your pick.\n\nSet of two lounge chairs.65",
