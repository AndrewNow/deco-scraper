The \"Trybo\" series was specifically created in 1964 for the Trysil Cabin, nestled in Trysil, Norway—the country's largest and most popular ski resort. \n\nThe \"Trybo\" chairs are distinguished by their bold square shapes and innovative construction method, which expertly employs wooden plugs rather than screws or glue to join the pieces. This artisanal approach not only enhances the visual appeal but also reflects the exceptional craftsmanship characteristic of Scandinavian design. \n\nEach chair features beautifully sculpted adjustable backrests made from high-quality pine wood, showcasing a natural patina that attests to their well-preserved vintage condition. The original upholstery, while displaying minor signs of use, adds a layer of charm and authenticity, enhancing the overall aesthetic of the chairs.\n\nThese unique pieces are primarily constructed from pine wood, crafted with meticulous attention to detail and a commitment to functional beauty. Among our collection of Edvin Helseth furniture, the brown editions of the \"Trybo\" model stand out as particularly sought after due to their timeless elegance and versatility. Much of Helseth's original work embodies the principles of Scandinavian Modern design, marked by simplicity, functionality, and a deep connection to natural materials, making his pieces highly revered in mid-century modern furniture circles.\n\n3 available, priced per chair.</span></div></div>",
