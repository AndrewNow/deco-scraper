        "description": "A distinguished pair of late 19th-century French armchairs in the Louis XVI style, sourced directly from Provence, France. Each chair boasts a hand-carved frame with a large, square-shaped back, displaying a naturally aged dark patina in a rich brown hue. Structurally restored for stability, the chairs retain their original green velvet upholstery, neatly finished with nailhead trim. The back is adorned with complementary plaid fabric, adding a touch of classic contrast. Gracefully tapered, fluted legs with toupie feet provide elegant support, while delicately carved rosettes embellish the front corners. Solid and stable, this pair exemplifies exceptional joinery and craftsmanship, embodying the timeless sophistication of the Louis XVI tradition.\n\n- Origin: Provence, France\n\n- Dimensions: W 23\" x D 24.5\" x H 38\"; Seat dimensions: W 20\" x D 19.25\" x H 20\" \n\n- Condition: The chairs have been structurally restored, while the original green velvet fabric remains in excellent condition. The wood features a beautifully aged patina.",
