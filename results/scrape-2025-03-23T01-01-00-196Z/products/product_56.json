Its design reflects a sense of dignity and purpose, with clean lines and balanced proportions that evoke both strength and serenity. Crafted to offer both comfort and intention, the Cristos invites its user to sit with a sense of reflection and poise.

Currently living in Stockholm, Sweden, Carlos and David have embarked on a collaborative venture to establish ‘Studio Romell.’ In this enterprise, their aspiration is to seamlessly blend their deep-rooted appreciation for exquisite objects with a genuine curiosity for people and architecture, all while steadfastly upholding their unwavering artistic vision. Within the realm of ‘Studio Romell,’ their exclusive focus remains on the meticulous crafting of high-end, brutal and minimal inspired furniture. This pursuit is characterized by their exclusive use of fine materials, including walnut, marble, bronze, Murano glass, and more. Notably, each piece is painstakingly manufactured within the boundaries of Europe, reflecting their profound commitment to quality. Collaborating with accomplished artisans scattered across the continent, they entrust these skilled hands with the vital role of bringing their designs to life. Studio Romell transports you to an alternate plane where you find yourself immersed in a collection of enigmatic artifacts from an unfamiliar territory, defying explanation by both time and physics. This uncovers a world and society shrouded in mystery, leaving you with an eerie sensation of being the first to stumble upon Romell's designs, as if they once belonged to a bygone, neither past or future society. Their origin, inception, and ultimate demise remain veiled in ambiguity, leaving us pondering the profound enigma of this world. In a realm where objects move in ways divergent from our habitual reality, these artifacts challenge the boundaries of imagination. Carlos brings a rich background in fine arts, while David, as a Co-designer, contributes his extensive 10 years of experience in the real estate world, combined with a keen interest in commerce and human-centered architecture. Together, they skillfully amalgamate their diverse talents and experiences in their passionate pursuit to create furniture that not only serves its utilitarian purpose but also stands as an enduring testament to their unwavering dedication to artistry.</span></div></div>",
