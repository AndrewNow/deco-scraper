Designed by the renowned French duo Ronan & Erwan Bouroullec, the Ploum sofa is a design masterpiece that embraces both form and comfort. Crafted with an organically shaped silhouette, this iconic piece reflects extensive research into ergonomics and materials, aiming to accommodate the natural posture of the human body in various seating positions.\n\nDesign\nIts generously tufted surface invites you to sink into its soft, cocooning curves, creating an inviting sanctuary in any living space. The warm Kvadrat Febrik exclusive upholstery enhances the tactile experience, while the tones of warm orange and ochreous bring a subtle yet bold accent that harmonizes beautifully with neutral or eclectic interiors. The Bouroullecs envisioned the Ploum sofa as a perfect balance of innovation and luxury. Described by the designers as “a combination of two materials, the stretch fabric and ultra-soft foam, which, when associated with a specific shape, offers great comfort and flexibility,” the Ploum sofa redefines the meaning of comfort. Its low-slung, fluid design and seamless aesthetic make it a striking statement piece for contemporary homes.\n\nOffering more than just a place to sit, the Ploum is a sculptural centerpiece that effortlessly combines artful minimalism with plush indulgence, perfect for those seeking to elevate their interiors with a touch of modern artistry. This sofa is a fusion of avant-garde design and practical functionality, offering a unique blend of comfort, style, and innovation.\n\nCondition\nThis sofa is newly upholstered.\n\nPlease contact us for the best shipping options and price.\nWe will discuss and figure out the best possible shipment method (and rate) for every individual object. \n\nPlease watch the video for a more accurate representation of the colors and details, as it sometimes offers a clearer view than the photos.\n",
