        "description": "Giovanni Michelucci “Torbecchia” dining chairs for Poltronova, Italy, 1964, set of six.\n\nCrafted from dark-stained beechwood with woven straw seats, the \"Torbecchia\" dining chairs for Poltronova represent a classic chic. With their single rail, curved backrest offering comfort and embrace, square legs and rectangular apron, they bear the designer's signature and the hallmark of Poltronova's rustic style. Featuring a simple yet enduring design and handmade from natural materials, these chairs pay homage to ancient craftsmanship with clear references to the typical elements of Charlotte Perriand's design. It's worth mentioning that the name \"Torbecchia\" comes from the homonymous hometown of the artist, near Pistoia, Tuscany. Experience the seamless blend of artistry and functionality with the \"Torbecchia\" chairs—a legacy of Michelucci's design and Poltronova's legacy of quality. Also, most of the chairs still wear the original \"Poltronova\" paper sticker on the bottom.\n\nWe offer custom restoration and special reupholstering on request. Our atelier enhances Italy's excellence by providing dedicated and tailor-made customization services. Contact us for additional information.\n",
